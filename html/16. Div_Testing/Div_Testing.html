			<p>The name of my home land is Bangladesh. It is a beautiful country. It become independent in 1971. Dhaka is its capital. Bangladesh is a small country. Its land area is about 1, 47,570 square kilometers. But it has large population. About 140 million people live here. Bangladesh is mainly an agricultural country.
